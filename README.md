# Titanic Dataset Analysis

This project involves an analysis of the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers on the RMS Titanic. The goal is to explore the dataset, visualize relationships between different features, and provide insights into trends like survival rates, age, fare distributions, and more.

## Project Overview

The Titanic dataset is widely used in machine learning challenges and serves as a great example for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature visualization.

In this project, I performed the following tasks:
- Load and clean the Titanic dataset
- Generate exploratory visualizations using libraries like `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, and `pandas`
- Perform correlation analysis
- Create a PDF report with observations and findings

## Contents

- **titanic.csv**: The dataset used for analysis
- **titanic_analysis.py**: Python script for loading, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the Titanic dataset
- **titanic_analysis_report.pdf**: PDF report with findings, visualizations, and analysis
- **visualizations**: Folder containing saved visualizations (pairplot, heatmap, histograms, boxplots)

## Installation

To run this project locally, you'll need to install a few dependencies. Use the following command to install them via `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn fpdf
Visualizations
This project includes the following visualizations:

Pairplot: A matrix of scatter plots showing relationships between features.

Heatmap: A correlation matrix heatmap displaying the relationships between numeric features.

Histograms: Distribution of age and fare.

Boxplots: Distribution of age and fare with outliers.

Observations
The pairplot reveals clusters between features such as Age and Survived.

The heatmap shows strong correlations between variables like Pclass and Fare.

Histograms of Age and Fare show skewed distributions.

Boxplots highlight the presence of outliers in both Age and Fare.

Conclusion
The dataset analysis reveals key patterns in the relationship between passenger characteristics and survival.

Further analysis and model development could focus on predicting survival based on the features in the dataset.

Handling missing values, feature engineering, and model tuning will improve prediction accuracy.
